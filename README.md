# React

The library for web and native user interfaves

- You can creates a Custom Tags with React.
- Components are like functions that return HTML elements. The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function.
- React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML. To send props into a component, use the same syntax as HTML attributes.
- React components has a built-in state object. The state object is where you store property values that belong to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
- useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.
- useState accepts an initial state and returns two values:  
  `The current state.`  
  `A function that updates the state.`
- React can perform actions based on user events. React has the same events as HTML: click, change, mouseover etc.
- event.preventDefault(): The preventDefault() method cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action that belongs to the event will not occur.
- React onChange is an event handler that triggers when there is any change in the input field.
